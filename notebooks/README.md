# Prompt Evolution Tutorials

Welcome to the SCOPE (Self-Correcting Optimal Prompt Evolution) tutorial notebooks!

## 📚 Notebooks

### 01_prompt_evolution_basics.ipynb
**Introduction to Prompt Evolution**

Learn how AI systems can automatically improve their own prompts through observation and learning.

**What you'll learn:**
- How SCOPE works
- Automatic prompt optimization
- Observing learning in real-time
- Measuring improvements
- LangChain integration

**Duration:** ~30-45 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Basic Python, understanding of LLMs  
**Best for:** First-time users, understanding fundamentals

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Setup

1. **Install Jupyter:**
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Start Jupyter:**
   ```bash
   cd notebooks
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Open the notebook** and follow along!

### Requirements

Make sure you have:
- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- Required packages (installed via notebooks)

## 💡 Learning Path

**Recommended order:**
1. Start with `01_prompt_evolution_basics.ipynb`
2. Run all cells sequentially
3. Experiment with the exercises
4. Try your own extraction tasks

## 🎯 What to Expect

Each notebook follows this structure:
1. **Concept Introduction** - What you'll learn
2. **Setup** - Installing packages and API keys
3. **Step-by-Step Code** - Building the solution
4. **Live Demonstration** - Watch SCOPE learn
5. **Analysis** - Understand the results
6. **Exercises** - Try it yourself

## 📊 Hands-On Approach

These are **interactive** notebooks:
- Run the code cells as you read
- See SCOPE learn in real-time
- Experiment with parameters
- Add your own tasks

## 🤔 Need Help?

- **Errors?** Check you have the OpenAI API key set
- **Questions?** See the main README.md
- **Want more?** Check out the full project documentation

## 🌟 Tips for Success

1. **Read the explanations** before running code
2. **Run cells in order** - they build on each other
3. **Watch the output** - learning happens live!
4. **Experiment** - try different tasks and parameters
5. **Compare results** - see how prompts improve
